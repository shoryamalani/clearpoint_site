This is a trivia app to help quizbowl players harness their craft and practice. The question is read to users the same way it is in quizbowl rooms and the speed can be changed. Users can also read the question as it shows up. A user can set the difficulty of the question and see the correct answers after it passes. Answering more quickly is rewarded similarly to how quizbowl works. We are so excited to bring this app to you and Are eager to hear feedback.

Please contact us at the email support@clearpointmanagement.com if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. 

More updates are right around the corner and we have so many more ideas including a possible multiplayer mode down the line so stick around.
